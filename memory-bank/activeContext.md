# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Simplified Architecture - Docker-Only Performance Monitoring**

The project has been simplified to focus on a lightweight, Docker-only performance monitoring solution. All Node.js dependencies have been removed, and the system now uses globally installed K6 for performance testing.

## Recent Changes
- **Architecture Simplification**: ✅ Removed all Node.js dependencies and runtime
- **Docker-Only Setup**: ✅ Simplified to Grafana and InfluxDB containers only
- **Global K6 Integration**: ✅ K6 now installed globally on the system
- **Test Organization**: ✅ Tests stored in `tests/` directory
- **Dashboard Configuration**: ✅ Pre-configured Grafana dashboards available
- **Memory Bank Update**: ✅ Updated documentation to reflect new architecture

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working ✅
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration for Grafana and InfluxDB
- ✅ Simplified architecture with minimal dependencies
- ✅ Pre-configured Grafana dashboards
- ✅ Data persistence configuration
- ✅ Network setup for inter-service communication
- ✅ Global K6 integration for performance testing

### What's Ready for Use
- **Docker Services**: Grafana and InfluxDB containers
- **Test Framework**: K6 globally installed for performance testing
- **Dashboard Templates**: Pre-configured Grafana dashboards
- **Data Persistence**: Metrics storage and visualization
- **Documentation**: Updated guides for simplified setup

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Completed)
- [x] Remove Node.js dependencies
- [x] Simplify Docker Compose configuration
- [x] Update documentation for global K6 usage
- [x] Organize test structure
- [x] Provide pre-configured dashboards

### Short-term Goals
1. **User Testing**: Test the simplified workflow end-to-end
2. **Test Examples**: Create sample K6 test scenarios
3. **Dashboard Enhancement**: Optimize pre-configured dashboards
4. **Documentation**: Add troubleshooting guides

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Advanced Test Scenarios**: Add more complex performance testing patterns
2. **Dashboard Templates**: Create additional dashboard configurations
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add automated testing and deployment
4. **Production Readiness**: Security hardening and production guides

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **No Node.js Runtime**: Eliminated to reduce complexity and dependencies
2. **Global K6 Installation**: Uses system-wide K6 for maximum compatibility
3. **Docker-Only Architecture**: Simplified to just Grafana and InfluxDB
4. **Test Organization**: Tests stored directly in `tests/` directory
5. **Dashboard Templates**: Pre-configured dashboards for easy import

### Implementation Choices
- **Docker Compose**: Container orchestration for easy setup
- **InfluxDB 1.8**: Legacy version for compatibility
- **Grafana**: Industry-standard visualization platform
- **Global K6**: System-wide installation for maximum compatibility

## Current Blockers
- None identified - simplified architecture is ready for use

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Completion ✅
- [x] Simplified architecture without Node.js
- [x] Docker-only setup with Grafana and InfluxDB
- [x] Global K6 integration
- [x] Pre-configured dashboards
- [x] Updated documentation

### Phase 2 Completion (In Progress)
- [x] End-to-end performance testing workflow

## Ready for User Testing
The simplified project is now complete and ready for users to:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install K6 globally
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start services
4. Create K6 tests in the `tests/` directory
5. View results in Grafana dashboards

## Simplified Architecture Benefits
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only Docker and K6 required
- **Easy Setup**: Single docker-compose command
- **Global K6**: No package management complexity
- **Pre-configured**: Ready-to-use dashboards
- **Lightweight**: Reduced system resource usage
