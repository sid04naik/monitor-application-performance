### Short-term Goals
1. **User Testing**: Test the complete workflow end-to-end including memory profiling
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Add troubleshooting guides and advanced usage
3. **Dashboard Templates**: Create additional dashboard configurations
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Add automated testing and deployment

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Advanced Test Scenarios**: Add more complex performance testing patterns
2. **Monitoring Alerts**: Implement performance threshold alerts
3. **Data Export**: Add test results export functionality
4. **Production Readiness**: Security hardening and production deployment guides
5. **Memory Analysis**: Advanced heap snapshot analysis and reporting

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **K6 Installation Method**: Using npm global installation for simplicity
2. **Configuration Management**: Environment variables with .env file support
