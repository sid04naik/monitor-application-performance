# Project Brief: Monitor Application Performance

## Project Overview
A local performance monitoring solution designed to test application performance on a local machine and visualize results through a Grafana dashboard.

## Core Requirements
1. **Performance Testing**: Execute K6 performance tests against target applications
2. **Data Collection**: Store performance metrics in InfluxDB
3. **Visualization**: Display performance data through Grafana dashboards
4. **Local Development**: Run entirely on local machine for development/testing purposes

## Key Goals
- Provide developers with local performance testing capabilities
- Enable real-time monitoring of application performance metrics
- Create a self-contained environment for performance analysis
- Support custom performance test scenarios

## Target Users
- Developers needing local performance testing
- QA teams requiring performance validation
- DevOps engineers monitoring application health

## Success Criteria
- Successfully execute K6 performance tests
- Store metrics in InfluxDB database
- Visualize data through Grafana dashboards
- Provide easy setup and configuration
- Support custom test scenarios

## Project Scope
- Local performance testing infrastructure
- Docker-based deployment
- K6 test execution
- InfluxDB metrics storage
